# Reddit periodical

This code generates a periodical based on reddit posts. It does this in a pretty naive way. It doesn't replace links or images for now but just tries to create a readable .mobi file for your Amazon Kindle.

Feel free to replace the data source by something else.

Enjoy!

## Important note
The [kindle-periodical](https://github.com/moszeed/kindle-periodical) library has a small bug: it is missing a `book` folder under `node_modules/kindle-periodical/src/`. You will have to create it manually.
